# Heart Disease Prediction- ystem using Machine Learning 
In recent few decades, heart problems emerge as a deadly disease and becomes the major cause for death of large number of people around the world. It is one of the life-threating disease that needs to be diagnosed early with an accurate, feasible and reliable system. Traditional methods for proper treatment of heart disease in time is not enough. Developing a disease prediction system based on Machine Learning algorithm provides a reliable and more accurate disease diagnosis than traditional methods.  A survey of various models is proposed which implements on such algorithms analyze their performances. In this project, a heart disease prediction system based on supervised learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT) and regression models: Linear Regression and Random Forest regression is presented determining the best accuracy rate among each.
